# SMS-Spam-Detection
This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam), implemented on Google Colab.

Project Overview
Objective: Detect and classify SMS messages as spam or ham.

Platform: Google Colab

Dataset: SMS messages with labels (spam/ham).

Libraries Used:

Python (on Google Colab)

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Workflow
Data Loading: Load the SMS dataset into Colab.

Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal)

Stopwords removal

Stemming or Lemmatization

Feature Engineering:

Convert text to numerical vectors (Bag of Words / TF-IDF)

Model Training:

Use models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.

Evaluation:

Assess models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

How to Run
Open the Google Colab file:
Open in Google Colab <!-- (You can insert link if hosted somewhere) -->

Ensure required libraries are installed (Colab usually pre-installs most).

Run each cell sequentially.

If libraries are missing, install them using:

python
Copy
Edit
!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
Future Improvements
Deploy the model as a web app (e.g., with Streamlit or Flask).

Add deep learning models like LSTM for enhanced performance.

Use a larger and more diverse SMS dataset.
